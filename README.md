# one_step_diffusion_dmd
The final project of an university course "Generative models based on diffusions". The task was to implement the [Distribution Matching Distillation paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18828).
It suggests a method that distill many-step generation diffusion model into only one-step, so that inference of the model was much faster: now we can infer model only one time.
